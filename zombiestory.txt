It has been a few days that I can't go out of the apartment. Too dangerous. But I'm running out of food and water, so I will have to take the risk.

First things first. I need to make sure that there are no walkers just out of the door. 
I look out the door and sure enough there is nothing out there. I turn around and pick up my weapon of choice... the trusty frying pan.

When I left the house, I tried to go to the nearest place possible looking out for the walkers. I managed to get to the garage at the end of the road safely but walkers surrounded me inside. It was still dripping in blood from yesterdays expedition.
I gripped onto the frying pan tightly and was ready for a scrap.
It was still covered in blood from yesterdays expedition. I was starting to question my choice of cooking vessel and pondered whether a wok or a skillet might have been able to do some more damage.

I so tried to leave the garage, and decided it was now or never, i needed to make my way to the shops on Stoughten Road. Little did i know that the zomnies were waiting outside. I so ran as fast as i could, trying to get some distance between myself and the zombies before they could react.

Suddenly the zombies started running towards me.
