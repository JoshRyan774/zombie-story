# zombie-story

In this assignment, you will familiarize with the Github platform and the workflow. We will create a zombie-apocalypse-themed story, all together. Each student can contribute with a small part of the story. Feel free to contribute more than once. 

## Prerequisites

1. Watch the **video tutorials about how to work with Github**
2. If you don't have one, **create a Github account** (you should have one from when you register your team for the group project) and **send me an email with your username**, so that I can invite you to the platform for our module
3. Make sure that you have a **text editor** on your machine. Notepad (in Windows), TextEdit (for Macs) or gedit (for Linux) work just fine. Alternative editors are Visual Studio Code, Atom, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs. Please choose one and, if needed, install it.

## Tasks

0. Check on Github if there are open pull requests. If there are some, choose one and approve it. If there are any problems in doing that, open an issue on Github. 
1. Clone this repository on you machine. You will be seeing the content in the ```master``` branch.
2. Create a new branch with your Surrey username (the first 7 letters in your Surrey email, something like am00343).
3. Open the ```zombiestory.txt``` file with a text editor. *IMPORTANT: do not use Word for editing the file, it needs to be edited with a simple text editor.*
4. Write your contribution to the story.
5. Commit your changes. Publish your branch on Github. 
6. Open a pull request for your changes. Name the pull request with your Surrey username.
